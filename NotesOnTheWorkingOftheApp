these commands have to be run inside the container so the host can see them in order for the app to run ok!! :

sudo chown -R $USER:www-data storage

sudo chown -R $USER:www-data bootstrap/cache

sudo chmod -R 775 storage

sudo chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache



then we must make sure that .env contains the correct database.
then run in php-cli container (in which we have artisan!) php artisan config:cache 

then if tables like session does not exist run migrations as :
php artisan session:table
php artisan migrate
